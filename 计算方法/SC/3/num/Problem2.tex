\begin{pro}
  Newton's method is sometimes used to implement the built-in
  root function on a computer, with the initial guess
  supplied by a lookup table.

  What is the Newton iteration for computing the square root of a
  positive number $y$ (i.e., for solving the equation
  $f(x)=x^2-y=0$, given $y$)?
\end{pro}

\begin{sol}
  \begin{displaymath}
    x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} = x_n - \frac{x_n^2 - y}{2x_n}
    = \frac{x_n^2 + y}{2x_n}.
  \end{displaymath}
\end{sol}
